# BWGC Golf Analytics Platform Development Steps

This document outlines the complete process to transform your Myrtle Beach golf tournament data into an interactive analytics platform hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Phase 1: Data Analysis & Preparation

### Step 1.1: Clean and Structure the Data
**Prompt to give Claude:** 
"Clean up the myrtleScores.csv file. Create a proper structured CSV with consistent column headers. Extract the following data into separate, clean CSV files: individual_scores.csv (player, day, course, score, par), match_play_results.csv (day 2 head-to-head results), team_scores.csv (daily team totals), and player_stats.csv (birdies, pars, bogeys, etc. per player). Make sure all data is properly formatted for analysis."

### Step 1.2: Calculate Advanced Statistics
**Prompt to give Claude:**
"Using the cleaned data, create a Python script called 'calculate_stats.py' that computes advanced golf statistics for each player: scoring average, scoring relative to par, consistency (standard deviation), best/worst rounds, head-to-head records, course difficulty analysis, and performance trends across the 4 days. Output results to a new file called 'advanced_stats.json'."

## Phase 2: Visualization Development

### Step 2.1: Set Up Web Development Environment
**Prompt to give Claude:**
"Create a modern web application structure for our golf analytics dashboard. Set up: package.json with React/Next.js, Chart.js or D3.js for visualizations, Tailwind CSS for styling, and a proper src/ directory structure. Include components for different chart types and a responsive layout. Make it ready for GitHub Pages deployment."

### Step 2.2: Create Core Data Visualizations
**Prompt to give Claude:**
"Build the following interactive charts using our golf data: 1) Player scoring progression line chart across 4 days, 2) Scoring distribution histogram showing each player's typical scores, 3) Head-to-head match play results matrix, 4) Course difficulty comparison (average scores per course), 5) Team performance comparison bar chart. Make each chart interactive with hover details and filtering options."

### Step 2.3: Build Statistical Dashboards
**Prompt to give Claude:**
"Create dashboard components that display: 1) Leaderboard with sortable columns (total score, average, best round, etc.), 2) Player profile cards showing key stats and performance highlights, 3) Fun facts section with automatically generated insights like 'Most consistent player', 'Biggest comeback', 'Course crusher', 4) Shot-by-shot heatmaps for each course showing where players struggled most."

## Phase 3: Advanced Analytics & Fun Features

### Step 3.1: Performance Analytics
**Prompt to give Claude:**
"Implement advanced analytics features: 1) Handicap calculator and tracking, 2) Performance prediction model for future tournaments, 3) Strength/weakness analysis per player (driving, putting, short game based on hole performance), 4) 'What if' scenarios (how different would results be with mulligan rules, best ball throughout, etc.), 5) Tournament format comparison tool."

### Step 3.2: Interactive Tournament Simulator
**Prompt to give Claude:**
"Build an interactive feature that lets users simulate different tournament formats using the same player performance data: scramble calculator, alternate shot simulator, match play bracket generator, and Ryder Cup style team competition scoring. Include animations and real-time scoring updates."

### Step 3.3: Fun Facts & Achievements Generator
**Prompt to give Claude:**
"Create an automated system that generates fun facts and achievements from the data: 'Most Improved Day-to-Day', 'Clutch Performer' (best under pressure), 'Course Specialist', 'Consistency King', 'Big Number Avoider', 'Match Play Dominator'. Include a badge system and social media ready graphics for sharing achievements."

## Phase 4: User Experience & Interactivity

### Step 4.1: Mobile-Responsive Design
**Prompt to give Claude:**
"Optimize the entire dashboard for mobile devices. Create touch-friendly navigation, swipeable chart galleries, collapsible stat sections, and ensure all visualizations work well on small screens. Add PWA capabilities so users can install it as a mobile app."

### Step 4.2: Data Entry Interface for Future Tournaments
**Prompt to give Claude:**
"Build a scorecard entry interface that allows easy input of future tournament data. Include: course setup (holes, par, handicaps), live scoring during rounds, automatic calculation of team formats, and export functionality to maintain the same data structure for future analysis."

### Step 4.3: Historical Tournament Comparison
**Prompt to give Claude:**
"Create a framework for adding and comparing multiple tournaments over time. Build interfaces to: upload new tournament data, compare performance across different locations/years, track long-term player improvement, maintain historical leaderboards, and identify recurring patterns in your friend group's golf performance."

## Phase 5: Deployment & Sharing

### Step 5.1: GitHub Pages Setup
**Prompt to give Claude:**
"Configure this repository for GitHub Pages deployment. Set up the build process, create the necessary GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment on push to main branch, configure custom domain if desired, and ensure all assets are properly linked for the gh-pages environment."

### Step 5.2: Performance Optimization
**Prompt to give Claude:**
"Optimize the site for fast loading: implement lazy loading for charts, compress images and data files, add service worker for caching, minify CSS/JS, and ensure the site loads quickly even on slower connections. Add loading states and error handling for a smooth user experience."

### Step 5.3: Social Sharing Features
**Prompt to give Claude:**
"Add social sharing capabilities: generate shareable cards for individual achievements, create tournament summary graphics, add meta tags for proper social media previews, and build a 'share your round' feature that creates custom graphics with player stats and course information."

## Phase 6: Advanced Features (Optional)

### Step 6.1: Data Export & Reporting
**Prompt to give Claude:**
"Build comprehensive reporting features: PDF tournament reports, Excel exports with all statistics, email-ready summaries, and printable scorecards. Include customizable report templates and automated report generation after each tournament."

### Step 6.2: Predictive Analytics
**Prompt to give Claude:**
"Implement machine learning features to predict future performance: handicap trending, optimal team pairing suggestions based on historical data, course strategy recommendations per player, and tournament outcome predictions based on current form."

### Step 6.3: Integration & API
**Prompt to give Claude:**
"Create an API layer for potential future integrations: webhook endpoints for real-time scoring apps, integration with popular golf tracking apps, export capabilities to major golf platforms, and a simple API for accessing tournament statistics programmatically."

## Development Tips for Each Phase

- **Start Small**: Begin with basic visualizations before adding complexity
- **Iterate Quickly**: Get each visualization working before perfecting the design
- **Test on Mobile**: Check responsive design after each major component
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity at each step
- **Version Control**: Commit after each completed step for easy rollback
- **Documentation**: Update README.md as features are added
